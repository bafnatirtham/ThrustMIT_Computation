Start a course on C eventually levelling up to C++(if needed).
Courses for your reference are attached at the end.

**Learn about loops in C/C++ Also learn about infinite loops and jump statements such as break, continue. and implement the following programs:**
- _**Problem 1**_: write a program to print the first ‘n’ Fibonacci numbers. Take n as input from user script
- _**Problem 2:**_ Input a number from user. If number = 0 ask again, else print the number. Keep doing this till a number less than 0 is entered by user. Hint: use continue and break statements.

**Learn about pointers in C/C++.**
- _**Problem 1:**_ Write a program to find out the greatest and the smallest among three numbers using pointers.
- _**Problem 2**_: write a program to swap two numbers using pointers

**Learn about arrays and strings and implement the following programs. Learn about sorting algorithms.**
- Problem 1: write a program for multiplying two matrix and store it in another matrix. Use 2-dimentional arrays. Extra points for using pointers.
- Problem 2: Find the largest and smallest element in arrays.
- Problem 3: Search for an element in an array using linear search and binary search.
- Problem 4 : sort an array using all the sorting techniques you have learnt.
- Problem 5: take a string as input and encode it using the 13-shift Caeser Cypher. Also Decode the string.
- Problem 6: take sentence as input and find the largest word. Also capitalize first letter of each word.

 
Go through the contents of any of the course, solve all the problem statements done in the video and submit it as a separate file in a separate folder called CODES with the report.

Make a report for all the things you have learnt. Include whatever you have learnt in the report as this report is going to be a reference for your future interviews. The report must be in IEEE format.
